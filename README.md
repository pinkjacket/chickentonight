# _Chicken Tonight_

#### _A recipe app incorporating not one but TWO Simpsons jokes, 3/23/2018_

#### By _**James Donlan**_

## Description

_Everybody loves cooking, so here's an app to let you search for recipes using the Yummly API. Just enter your search term and hit the button, and you'll get a scrollable list of recipes! Ability to actually click through to them coming soon. You'll have to make an account, but it just needs an e-mail and a password._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Import project into Android Studio, preferably using the program itself_
* _Gradle will refuse to compile, go to the terminal and create gradle.properties and open it in Atom_
* _Insert your Yummly app ID and key as YummlyId and YummlyToken respectively_
* _Save and resync Gradle (may have to do this twice)_
* _Select "app" in the dropdown menu on the top right next to the green arrow, then click the arrow_
* _Set up an emulated Android phone to run it on. I recommend a Nexus 6 running Marshmallow or above, but anything above Ice Cream Sandwich should be all right_
* _Enjoy!_

## Proposed Future Functionality

* _Implement recipe details, which requires a separate API call (this is almost done, but not quite ready!)_
* _Use images from API results_
* _Make prettier_

## Technologies Used

* _Java_
* _Android_
* _Firebase_
